cd ~/sketchbook/libraries (or ~/Documents/Arduino/libraries)
git clone https://github.com/matafonoff/J1850-VPW-Arduino-Transceiver-Library
restart arduino
then you can run this.

see include PDF for details on the J1773 inductive charging standard.  There is a single wire that goes between the paddle socket and the electric vehicle, that's where you connect your circuit (similar to the one described by the J1850 library linked above)
